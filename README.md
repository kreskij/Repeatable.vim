# Repeatable.vim

Repeatable.vim provides a simple interface to create dot(.) repeatable mappings via tpope's 
[repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat). Add
```Repeatable``` in front of your mapping and it will be
repeatable. This works with the various mapping arguments such as
```<silent>```, ```<expr>```, ```<buffer>```, etc. It is designed to work exactly
as you'd expect with a typical mapping, except repeatable.

## Example with Repeatable.vim

```vim
Repeatable nnoremap gp p`]
```

## Example without Repeatable.vim

```vim
nnoremap <silent> <Plug>PasteBelowCursorEnd p`]
\:call repeat#set("\<Plug>PasteBelowCursorEnd")<CR>
nmap gp <Plug>PasteBelowCursorEnd
```


Many users install repeat.vim as a supplement to other plugins
however some may shy away from creating their own mappings due to its interface
being verbose or intimidating. This plugin reduces it down to one ```Repeatable```
command which you add as a prefix to your mapping. No need to mess with 
custom ```<Plug>``` mappings, Repeatable.vim will take care of that for you.



## Install with on-demand loading

Add the ```Repeatable``` command to on-demand loading if your plugin manager supports it. 

```vim
" Example using vim-plug and on-demand loading
Plug 'tpope/vim-repeat'
Plug 'kreskij/Repeatable.vim', { 'on': 'Repeatable' }
```

## Install without on-demand loading
If your plugin manager doesn't support on-demand loading, call
the ```repeatable#Setup()``` function before any use of the ```Repeatable``` command

```vim
" Example using vim-plug and without on-demand loading
Plug 'tpope/vim-repeat'
Plug 'kreskij/Repeatable.vim'
"...
call repeatable#Setup()
```


## Usage

Define mappings as you normally would and add ```Repeatable``` in front. 

This plugin works with ```<expr>``` mappings too.

## Examples

```vim
" Paste below/above and put cursor at the end of the paste
Repeatable nnoremap gp p`]
Repeatable nnoremap gP P`]

" Paste inside current line (overwrites line) (repeatable)
Repeatable nnoremap <expr> gpp '"_dd"'.v:register.'P'
```
